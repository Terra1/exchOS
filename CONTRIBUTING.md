Contributing Guidelines:
1: Write good code.
2: Comment everything even remotely complicated, it might seem unnecessary now, but trust me, the second you look away from your screen, everything you coded just moments ago will look like gibberish.
3: Compile first, commit second, test third.
4: All code must be licensed under the GPLv3 or a compatible license.
